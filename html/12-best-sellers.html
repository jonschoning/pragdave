<h1 id="kata-twelve-best-sellers">Kata Twelve: Best Sellers</h1>
<p>Consider the implementation of a top-ten best sellers list for a high volume web store.</p>
<p>A GedankenKata this week: no code needed (although writing short prototypes might help you come to a conclusion).</p>
<p>Say youâ€™re writing code for an online site that sells things (something like Amazon). Your site is wildly popular, and you sell millions of items each day.</p>
<p>The marketing department wants the home page to display a top-ten list of the best selling items over the last 24 hours, with the list being updated each hour.</p>
<ul>
<li>How would you implement this?</li>
<li>Are there any changes you could ask for to make the implementation easier?</li>
<li>What would be the impact if they later came back and said:</li>
<li>Only update the list once per day; or</li>
<li>We need the list updated in real time: each time the home page is displayed we need the list to reflect the 24 hours up until that point.</li>
</ul>
<p>This kata might be deeper than it first appears. You might want to consider database vs. in-memory solutions, data structures that allow aging, time-space tradeoffs, and the like.</p>
